I have had my MacBook Pro for almost a year now and in that time I switched to macOS only and learnt more about coding. So I'm here to tell you about my experience so far.

When I first got my MacBook Pro I Was still just doing basic html css and js and did not even know how to use the terminal. But other time I have learnt to use the terminal and other.
